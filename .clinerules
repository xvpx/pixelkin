# .clinerules: Projects Directory Intelligence

## Project Organization
1. All projects are created as root-level directories in c:/Users/Dustin/Documents/Projects
2. Each project should have its own README.md file
3. Use consistent naming conventions for project directories (e.g., lowercase with hyphens)

## Documentation
1. Central documentation is maintained in the memory-bank/ directory
2. Project-specific documentation should be kept within each project's directory
3. Use Markdown (.md) for all documentation files
4. Include Mermaid diagrams for visual representations when appropriate

## Version Control
1. Each project should have its own Git repository
2. Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits style
3. Create a .gitignore file for each project to exclude unnecessary files

## Code Style
1. Use consistent indentation (prefer spaces over tabs)
2. Follow language-specific style guides for each project
3. Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project Creation
1. Use project templates when available (to be created)
2. Initialize new projects with a basic README.md and .gitignore file
3. Document project setup steps in the project's README.md

## Workflow
1. Update memory-bank/activeContext.md when switching focus between projects
2. Regularly update memory-bank/progress.md to track overall progress
3. Review and update .clinerules as new patterns emerge

## Tool Usage
1. Prefer using provided tools (e.g., list_files, read_file) over CLI commands when possible
2. Use the replace_in_file tool for making targeted changes to existing files
3. Utilize the search_files tool to find specific code patterns or TODO comments across projects

## Project Intelligence
1. Document project-specific patterns in each project's README.md
2. Update .clinerules with patterns that apply across multiple projects
3. Use comments to explain complex code sections or important decisions

Remember: This file is a living document. Update it regularly as new patterns and best practices emerge throughout the development process.
